# Issues list (Vlad)

## New

* Finished student page
* Added transition on buttons

## Old things that's been reworked

* Left & Right padding on section content has been removed as Peter told me to so as the content has the width of the container
* Fixed some align issues in the first tab that were caused by reworking of the section paddings (.no-pl)
* Reworked buttons to have button-gray class
